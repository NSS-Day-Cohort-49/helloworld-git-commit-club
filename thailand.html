          <h3>Landmarks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Khao Phing Kan, Phang Nga Bay</li>
            <blockquote>
              One of Thailand’s most iconic natural landmarks, Khao Phing Kan is
              more commonly known as James Bond Island due to appearing in the
              1974 Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun. Located in the scenic
              Phang Nga Bay, the spire-like limestone karst rises up from
              shimmering waters with other greenery-clad rocks in the
              background. Take a day trip from Krabi or Phuket to explore the
              beautiful area and enjoy kayaking around the jutting island for
              unbeatable views.
            </blockquote>
            <li>Cheow Larn Lake, Khao Sok National Park</li>
            <blockquote>
              With its karst scenery and thickly forested interior, beautiful
              Khao Sok National Park in Southern Thailand has extraordinary
              biodiversity supporting elephant, tiger and gibbon as well as
              hundreds of bird species. It is also home to Cheow Larn Lake, an
              artificial lake constructed in 1987, which is a beautiful emerald
              colour framed by green rainforest and limestone karsts. It is
              possible to stay on Cheow Larn Lake in floating lodges or luxury
              tents; a once in a lifetime experience. Wake early to watch the
              sunrise, listen to the monkeys calling and birds singing and take
              a kayak through the calm waters to spot wildlife.

              Koh Tao, Koh Nang Yuan is made up of three tiny tropical islands
              that are all connected by a sand bar, an iconic Thai image. Each
              island is made from rocky outcrops and covered in emerald jungle
              and the beaches feature powder-white sand and warm turquoise
              waters.The best way to see Koh Nang Yuan is to hike to the famous
              viewpoint where you will be rewarded by stunning views of the
              three paradise islands.
